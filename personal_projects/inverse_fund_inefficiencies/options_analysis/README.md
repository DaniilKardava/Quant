## Once again, additional research has been done in the "Updates" folder in the main directory. It includes improved code for analyzing option returns.

## Summary

I've provided a script for analyzing options returns. In order to experiment with your own contracts, retrieve your Robinhood auth token by interacting with the Robinhood platform while logged into your account. Inspect the networks tab and find a request that carriers the token in its header.

I'm only leaving an image of the returns of a strategy with highest potential, which is discussed under in the Updates folder.

This is an image of an equal weights portfolio containing short shares of SQQQ and TQQQ.
