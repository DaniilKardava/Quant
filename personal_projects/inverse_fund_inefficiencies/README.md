## Summary

Recently I've noticed that ETFs providing leverage and negative exposure fail to track the benchmark, even for the single day period as designed. I have looked extensively at the returns formed by capturing these divergences and concluded that the assets held by these funds are very sensitive to interest rates. The returns formed as a result of these discrepancies are in turn passed on to the price of shares, which I attempt to leverage through shorts and derivatives. 

Below are examples of the portfolio returns previously discussed and an illustration of the gradual divergence between two funds.  

This image shows a portfolio maintaining equal weights in SPY and SH (an inverse SPY ETF).
